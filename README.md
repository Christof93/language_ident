# Language identification with Python
Reimplementation of automatic language identification for demonstration purposes with minimal usage of existing libraries. (numpy)

### Testing the code

1. set up a python 3 virtual environment ```python3 -m venv```
2. install the minimum required packages ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements_analysis.txt```
 or ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements_method.txt``` if you just want to test the Naive Bayes model without the analysis notebook.
3. Run the notebook ```jupyter notebook test_li.ipynb```
 or test the code by importing nb_classifier.py and features.py
